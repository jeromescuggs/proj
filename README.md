##jeromeprojekt

if you have somehow stumbled upon this, i apologize, because there's not much to
see here. this is merely my 'project' folder - or should i say, it is one of
them, synchronized with git for access whereever i go. 

"why isn't it private?" you may ask, and the short answer is simply "ease of use", so i can access this repo even on systems where i don't feel comfortable using any sort of login information - or simply being able to share a file with someone who might not be too familiar with git. 

##contents
* monoeye - working dir for monoeye, which is also hosted here
* cinema - files needed for hosting asciinema on my webserver
* mechanized - working dir for /mechanized, my personal blog... sort of
