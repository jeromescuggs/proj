# Monoeye - monokai, except gundam 

Like alot of folks, I too started using the Monokai color theme as my default scheme in my various editors and terminal emulators. Perhabs unlike alot of folks, however, I became fascinated with why it was such an excellent pallette. 

## Origin

I don't think I found a universal answer here, but I certainly think I discovered why it was such an alluring scheme for me personally: it reminded me of the vivid and beautiful colors of one of my favorite series of all time, Mobile Suit Gundam.

## Status

This is still a work in progress - I'm not a fan, personally, of jet-black backgrounds - so I'm going to find a better color to use. 

Besides that, there are some other things I need to work out, but please be patient because I'm still sort of trying to figure out the basics of base16 color schemes.

## Color inspirations

This is a quick breakdown of the specific sources for the colors used here.

### Finished, more or less

* Red: can there even be a choice here? I sourced the reds from the one and only Char, and his custom Zaku II. 
* Green: similarly, this was a no-brainer: the green shades come straight from the legendary MS-06 Zaku II. 
* Yellow: this one was a bit tricker, and I'm still a bit torn. I wanted to go with the yellows found on the RX-78 Gundam, but I wound up going with the yellows found on the typical uniform worn by Zeon forces. This pallette might wind up being a 'Zeon' theme - which means I'll have to do a 'Federation' theme as well :)
* Pink: of all the no-brainers so far, this is the no-brainest: the pinks come from the same thing which inspired the pun-tastic name of the theme: the infamous Zaku II 'Mono-Eye'

### Unfinished

* Blue: oddly enough, I found the colors for blue while taking some screencaps of the Black Tri-Stars and their mobile suits - which seems like an obvious source for more purple-ish or black-ish colors. It wasn't perfect though, and I found a suitable light-colored blue in the default color of the MS-07 Gouf. 
* Cyan: So far I managed to accidentally keep the colors in theme with a sort of MS0079 / Zeon theme, but the natural choice here seems like it would be to source the colors from Zeta Gundam's Kamille Biden. I'll look around some more. 
* Whites: Probably going to source the white-ish/light grey colors from the RX-78, it only seems natural. 

### Installation 

** For now, the theme comes in a .flutecolors file, which is the theme file used by a newer terminal emulator, [Fluent Terminal](https://github.com/felixse/FluentTerminal). I'll be porting it to more universal formats soon, but the priority, obviously, will be actually finishing up the colors themselves. **
